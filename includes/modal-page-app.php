    </h2> 
    <p>is the app for traditional Gaudiya style Kirtan and 
contemporary Vaishnava music. It’s an easy switch between the two channels: 24 Hour Kirtan Radio and Ray-
dio Kirtan.</p>

<p>Besides live streaming, you can enjoy other audio media, such as Mangala arati, Guru-puja and Gaura-arati playlists, Srila Prabhupada’s japa chanting and his daily lecture. To quickly fill your space with the right mood, we said: “Ragas. Morning, mid-day and evening ragas.”  Pretty much everything, ha?</p>

<p>We didn’t forget about live streaming of devotional and meditational pictures either. You can choose between five galleries, every app’s update brings you new and exciting art, presented in our Featured Artists section. You better keep your Kirtanapp up-to-date.</p>

<p>Kirtanapp is easy and friendly to navigate and it’s coming to your screens shorty.</p>
