    </h2> 
    <p>Raydio Kirtan .FM is a contemporary Vaishnava radio station with music of various genres and its fusions. It’s a blend of rock, pop, electronica, hip-hop, ethno, drum’n’bass, breakbeat, techno, krishnacore, acoustic ... We’re presenting and broadcasting new, strictly Vaishnava’s music production as well as some classics.</p>

    <p>K is for Krishna, and K is for Kirtan. Raydio K are Krishna’s devotees: Nanda Kishor Das from Switzerland and Dhyanachandra Das from Slovenia. Our main and very simple goal is to bring the Yuga-dharma - Harinam-sankirtan in the ether, to as many of those as possible: loud speakers, headphones, amplifiers, cellphones, laptops and tablets. We wish they all vibrate and resonate in Kirtan and the holyname.</p>

    <p>We’re always happy when we hear new music: albums and sets, even mixtapes. You’re more then welcome to send us an e-mail with the links to your downloadable tracks you made yourself or you love hearing.</p>

    <p>Ray-<br />
    dio Kirtan*s music selection is lovingly curated by Dhyanachandra Das.</p>
